# The Database Creation python file serves as a populate file to create the sql database file for categories, questions, answers, and the primary key in the Quiz Bowl GUI.

# The quiz_question.db python file contains the information of the data populated from the Database Creation file.

# The Quiz Bowl is run through the Quizbowl.py file, This will prompt a window to select the category of your choice. Each question prompts the user to type in an answer in the entry boxes provided.

# Correct answers are highlighted in green whereas an incorrect answer would highlight it red. The score is also kept and displayed at the end of the Quiz Bowl. Feel free to run the program across all categories as they will test the knowledgeability of the classes I have taken over the semesters.
